            <p>
                I found a love for me
                Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
                I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
                I never knew you were 
                The someone waiting for me
                'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
                Not knowing what it was
                I will not give you up this time
                But darling, just kiss me slow, 
                Your heart is all I own
                And in your eyes, you're holding mine
                </p>
            <p></p>
