                <p>
                    I found a love for me
                    Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
                    I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
                    I never knew you were 
                    The someone waiting for me
                    'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
                    Not knowing what it was
                    I will not give you up this time
                    But darling, just kiss me slow, 
                    Your heart is all I own
                    And in your eyes, you're holding mine
                </p>
                <p>
                    Baby, I'm dancing in the  dark 
                    With you between my arms
                    Barefoot on the grass, listening 
                    To our favourite song
                    When you said you looked a mess, 
                    I whispered underneath my breath
                    But you heard it, darling, 
                    You look perfect tonight

                    Well I found a woman, 
                    Stronger than anyone I know
                    She shares my dreams, I hope 
                    That someday I'll share her home
                    I found a love, to carry more 
                    Than just my secrets
                    To carry love, to carry children 
                    Of our own
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are still kids, but 
                    We're so in love
                    Fighting against all odds
                    I know we'll be alright this time
                    Darling, just hold my hand
                    Be my girl, I'll be your man
                    I see my future in your eyes

                    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, 
                    With you between my arms
                    Barefoot on the grass, listening 
                    To our favourite song
                    When I saw you in that dress, 
                    Looking so beautiful
                    I don't deserve this, darling, 
                    You look perfect tonight
                </p>
